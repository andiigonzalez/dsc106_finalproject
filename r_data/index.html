        <p>Step 1</p>
        <p>Surgeries are distributed among different organ systems. Let's explore the breakdown.</p>
        <p>The human body is a very complicated thing that fights diseases but sometimes needs help from surgeons. In Korea, a database of 6388 surgeries was gathered with every detail recorded.
          From the data, we can see that 31% of the procedures were digestive system procedures, dominating all other surgery fields. But, colorectal procedures were a substantial 16%, together, they accounted for nearly half of all surgeries. Reproductive System surgeries claim 13% of the surgical pie, however, cardiovascular procedures, despite the significant importance of the heart in the body, only accounted for 4%.
          Lymphatic/ endocrine systems accounted for 6%, while urinary for 5%. Hepatic surgeries were 7%, but the most interesting thing was how the pancreatic/biliary systems accounted for 0%, suggesting the extreme rarity of these surgeries.  
          These statistics paint a picture of how common some of these surgeries are and also which parts of the body may be more vulnerable than others. Each percentage reflects thousands of human experiences—moments of fear, hope, and recovery. Behind every statistic stands a patient whose life was altered when their body became the site of surgical intervention—each one a story of medicine's triumph and human resilience. </p>

        <p>Step 2</p>
        <p>Among these, a subset of surgeries is related to cancer.</p>


        <p>One of the medical world’s biggest problems is cancer and the effect it has on millions of people’s lives, but certain parts of the body are more affected than others. 
          Out of all colorectal surgeries, 88% were to treat cancer diagnosis and reproductive systems were followed by 76% of all surgeries for cancer diagnosis. Hepatic procedures reveal the attack of cancer on the liver, with 66% of surgeries addressing cancer diagnosis, but digestive system surgeries address only 45% of cancer diagnoses. 
          The lymphatic/endocrine system surgeries have a proportion of 13% of cancer diagnoses, with the urinary system following with a modest 13%. The cardiovascular system largely escapes the troubles of cancer, with only 5% of the surgeries resulting in cancer diagnosis, but the pancreatic system results in 50% of cancer diagnoses out of the small number of surgeries. 
          The human body is affected by cancer in different ways, and some parts of the body are more vulnerable to cancer than others, while other parts, like the heart, are rarely affected by malignancies. </p>

        <p>Step 3</p>
        
        <p>Among cancer-related surgeries, how do male and female patients compare?</p>


        <p>Regardless of gender, cancer strikes, and the bodies bear the difficulties differently. </p><p>Reproductive system surgeries affect more women than men, with 90% of reproductive cancer diagnoses affecting women, while males are only affected 10% of the time. However, the colorectal system reveals the opposite pattern, with 60% of cancer surgeries affecting men while women are only affected 40% of the time. The digestive system cancer is skewed towards men at 62% and women at 38%. The hepatic system follows this trend with 79% males and 21% females. The pancreatic/biliary system demonstrates parity with 0% each, and the lymphatic/endocrine system is slightly tilted towards women at 67% versus 33% for men. The urinary system shows a bias with males, with 66% of all cancer diagnoses for men and 34% only for females. However, the cardiovascular system has a very pronounced bias, with 94% of surgeries resulting in male cancer diagnosis while females account for 6%. As seen from the analysis data, cancer affects genders in different ways and affects the organs differently. </p>
