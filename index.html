        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Watch as the scalpels move toward the patient, preparing for surgery.</p>
        <p> Modern medicine has come far, especially in surgical fields. 
        However there is still much to be learned in order to achieve greater health outcomes. 
        Cancer is a malady that affects seemingly anyone at random based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4rxlRsNcs8&ab_channel=JohnsHopkinsMedicine">certain medical studies</a>. 
        But what if we told you that given extensive surgical data, we can find patterns that show significant disparities between men and women—depending on the different organs and systems in the body? 
        Why do some cancers disproportionately affect one gender over the other? 
        And what can we learn from these disparities?</p>

      <div class="step" data-step="1">
        <h3>Surgeries Across Organ Systems</h3>
        <p>Surgeries are performed all over the human body and the majority are distributed among different organ systems. Let's explore that breakdown together.</p>
        <p>The human body is a complex organism that has historically adapted to fight diseases but sometimes needs a little help from surgeons. Our <a href="https://vitaldb.net/dataset/">dataset</a> is a Korean medical collection of 6388 surgeries was gathered with every detail recorded.</p>
          <p>From the data, we can see that 31% of the procedures were digestive system procedures, dominating all other surgery fields. Moreover, colorectal procedures were a substantial <b>16%</b>, together, they account for nearly half of all surgeries. Reproductive System surgeries claim 13% of the surgical pie, however, cardiovascular procedures, despite the significant importance of the heart in the body, only accounted for 4%.</b>
          <p>Lymphatic/ endocrine systems accounted for 6%, while urinary for 5%. Hepatic surgeries were 7%, but the most interesting thing was how the pancreatic/biliary systems accounted for 0%, suggesting the extreme rarity of these surgeries. </p> 
          <p>These statistics paint a picture of how common some of these surgeries are and also which parts of the body may be more vulnerable than others. Each percentage reflects thousands of human experiences—moments of fear, hope, and recovery. Behind every statistic stands a patient whose life was altered when their body became the site of surgical intervention—each one a story of medicine's triumph and human resilience, or a recorded loss. </p>

      <div class="step" data-step="2">
        <h3>Addressing Cancer via Surgery</h3>
        <p>Now, let's dive deeper. We're not just looking at surgeries—we're specifically analyzing those that are a direct result of cancer diagnoses. This view highlights the proportion of surgeries that were cancer-related, showing which organ systems are most affected based on the data. Some patterns may seem expected, while others might surprise you.</p>

        <p>Cancer remains one of the most prolific diagnosis yet the cure is still elusive in the medical field, it remains one of the world's biggest ailment and the effect it has on millions of people's lives is vast. 
        According to the data, certain parts of the body are more affected than others.</p>
        <p>Starting with the data, we can see that out of all colorectal surgeries, 88% of them took place as a consequence of cancer diagnoses. 
        Reproductive systems closely followed this trend by cancer diagnoses making up 76% of all surgeries for this system. 
        Hepatic procedures reveal the attack of cancer on the liver, with 67% of surgeries serving to address their cancer diagnoses. 
        On the other hand, only 46% of digestive system surgeries address cancer diagnoses. </p>
        <p>The lymphatic/endocrine system surgeries have a proportion of 13% of cancer diagnoses, with the urinary system following with a modest 13%. The cardiovascular system seems to largely escape the troubles of cancer, with only 5% of the surgeries taking place to address cancer diagnoses, but the pancreatic system results in 75% of cancer diagnoses out of the small number of surgeries from that system. </p>
        <p>The human body is affected by cancer in different ways, and given the data, it seems some parts of the body might be more vulnerable to cancer than others, while other parts, like the heart, are rarely affected by malignancies. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="step" data-step="3">
        <h3>Gender Parity among Cancer Patients</h3>
        
        <p>But among this subset of cancer-related surgeries, how do male and female patients compare? Are they affected in a similar way? When we break these system surgeries down by gender, we observe some stark differences in their distribution. 
        Could lifestyle, biology, or screening disparities be responsible? This is where research is needed, and our visualization helps to raise these questions at a glance.</p>

        <p>We can see that regardless of gender, cancer strikes, and the bodies bear the difficulties differently. 
          Reproductive system surgeries affect more women than men, with 90% of reproductive cancer diagnoses affecting women, while males are only affected 10% of the time.</p>
        <p>However, the colorectal system reveals the opposite pattern, with 60% of cancer surgeries affecting men while women are only affected 40% of the time. 
          The digestive system cancer is skewed towards men at 62% and women at 38%. The hepatic system follows this trend with 79% males and 21% females.</p> 
        <p>The pancreatic/biliary system demonstrates parity with a 51%/49% split, and the lymphatic/endocrine system is slightly tilted towards women at 67% versus 33% for men. 
          The urinary system shows a bias with males, with 66% of all cancer diagnoses for men and 34% only for females. However, the cardiovascular system has a very pronounced bias, with 94% of surgeries resulting in male cancer diagnosis while females account for 6%. 
          As seen from the analysis data, cancer affects genders in different ways and affects the organs differently. </p>

        <p> Ultimately, these disparities show a need for further research in areas where cancer is heavily skewed towards a particular gender. Maybe by researching these differences, treatments and prevention practices could drastically imporve for certain patients. </p>

        <h3>So what?</h3>
        <p>Understanding these issues requires more than just raw data. We need a way to see these patterns—literally. That’s why our visualization goes beyond traditional statistics, linking each organ system to its corresponding surgical data.</p>
        <p>By associating numbers with human anatomy, we make the data intuitive and engaging. Moreover, with the provided models, users can quickly identify where in the body these organ systems are located, by hovering over each system a highlight of the organ is represented, therefore making our visualization a valuable teaching tool with which to effectively showcase health data to those unfamiliar with medicine who might be responsible for ancillary duties related to the medical field; such as healthcare administrators who might be tasked with supporting research funding efforts.</p>

        <p>Although it was a bit challenging to implement, our visualization's seamless scrolling transitions allow for seamless back and forth viewing. This allows the user to observe the overall proportion of surgeries, to how many of those are cancer-related, to the gender parity analysis.The visualization also provides the hovering function mentioned previously which serves as a great tool for understanding the human body.</p> <p> We hope that this type of presentation can help with surgical-oncology coordination efforts in hospitals in order to maximize staffing efficiency and create better patient outcomes, as well as encourage research efforts to investigate the gender disparity with the goal to create treatments and preventative measures.</p>
        <p>The surgical data tells a story that demands attention, and by understanding where disparities exist, we can work towards solutions: earlier detection, targeted awareness, and improved healthcare access.</p>
